## Studio's Site
  The main site for the studio (designed and programmed by [@Joseph-Ladino](https://github.com/Joseph-Ladino)). Includes a project switch and a lifetime's worth of sleep deprivation.

## Update Schedule
  At the moment, it's whenever I'm not passed out from being up all night working on this.

## Goals
  Within the next week or two, most assets and audio files should be done or nearly finished for our premiere game.
Ideally, there will be more to come, depending on the success of this one (as in, if it doesn't turn out awful).
Hopefully this org won't be as dead as I am inside after our first project's completion.
