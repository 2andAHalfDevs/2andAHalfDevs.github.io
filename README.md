# Thank you Frank Poth
  The example code belongs to [Frank Poth](https://github.com/frankarendpoth/frankarendpoth.github.io).
I'm learning as I go but for right now a lot of my code (i.e. collision boxes) are heavily based off his tutorials/source code.
His youtube videos and in-code comments are amazing, give him a look.
  
## Studio's Site
  The main site for the studio (designed and programmed by [@Joseph-Ladino](https://github.com/Joseph-Ladino)). Includes a project switch and a lifetime's worth of sleep deprivation.

## Update Schedule
  At the moment, it's whenever I'm not passed out from being up all night working on this.

## Goals
  Within the next week or two, most assets and audio files should be done or nearly finished for our premiere game.
Ideally, there will be more to come, depending on the success of this one (as in, if it doesn't turn out awful).
Hopefully this org won't be as dead as I am inside after our first project's completion.
